This is a java code that I have written in the context of an Assignment during my first year at Dalhousie University

This code display a rectangle (paddle) and a ball and keeps count of the score
	
	**Score**
	Every time the ball hit the wall(Edge) behind the paddle, the score increments by one (+1)
	When the players blocks the ball with the paddle, if the score is greater that zero, it decrements

	**Paddle**
	The players uses "w" to move the paddle up and "s" to move down

	**Ball**
	Every time the ball hits any wall or the paddle, it bounces back

	**End**
	The game ends in two cases
		The score gets to 50 and the player loses
		The ball gets stuck behind the paddle
	If the game end, re-run the code to start again
